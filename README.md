# Card Organizer

This script is designed to automatically sort and organize image files, specifically PNG files representing cards, into a structured directory hierarchy. It's particularly useful for managing collections of card images from various sources, such as those found in Illusion games or other card-based media.

## Features

*   **Automated Sorting:** The script automatically analyzes image files and sorts them into appropriate directories based on extracted metadata.
*   **Metadata-Driven Organization:**  Organization is based on metadata embedded within the card image files. This could include information like the game of origin, character name, card type, or other relevant attributes.
*   **Structured Directory Hierarchy:** The script creates a well-organized directory structure, making it easy to browse and locate specific cards.
*   **PNG Support:** The script is optimized for PNG image files, a common format for card images.
*   **Customizable:** The script can be customized to support different metadata formats and directory structures.

## How It Works

1.  **Input:** The script takes a directory containing unsorted card image files as input.
2.  **Metadata Extraction:** It analyzes each image file to extract relevant metadata.
3.  **Directory Creation:** Based on the extracted metadata, the script creates a directory structure. For example, it might create subdirectories for each game, character, or card type.
4.  **File Placement:** The script then moves each card image file into the appropriate directory within the newly created structure.
